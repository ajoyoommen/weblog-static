After hosting this blog on EC2 for some months, I decided that I should try hosting on AWS Lambda

A bit challenging, initially. However, I managed to host Django on AWS lambda with relative ease.

No extra costs. However I still had to host a database.

Right now, I am finally convinced that a static blog generator is the best thing.
