An identity-based cryptography uses the public ID of a user to create his public key. This eliminates the need for Certificate Authority and the associated security problems. A practical IBC system was proposed by Boneh-Franklin. In a paper with the same title as this post, the author has discussed about using distributed key generation for the BF IBC.
